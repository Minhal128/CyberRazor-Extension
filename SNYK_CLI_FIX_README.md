# CyberRazor Extension - Snyk CLI Fix & Hardcoded Scanner

## Problem Fixed

The original CyberRazor extension was failing with the error:
```
ERROR: Command execution error: spawn C:\Users\Minhal Rizvi\AppData\Roaming\npm\snyk ENOENT
```

This error occurred because:
1. Snyk CLI was not properly installed or accessible
2. The extension couldn't find the Snyk executable in Windows PATH
3. The extension had dependency on external Snyk CLI installation

## Solution Implemented

We've completely replaced the Snyk CLI dependency with a **hardcoded vulnerability scanner** that:

✅ **Works without Snyk CLI installation**
✅ **Uses built-in security patterns** 
✅ **Scans files safely without external dependencies**
✅ **Outputs results in JSON format in the logs**
✅ **Generates beautiful HTML reports**
✅ **Works immediately after installation**

## New Features

### 1. Hardcoded Vulnerability Patterns
The scanner now includes built-in detection for:

- **Hardcoded Passwords** (High severity)
- **Hardcoded API Keys/Tokens** (High severity)
- **SQL Injection patterns** (High severity)
- **Eval usage** (High severity)
- **Command Injection** (High severity)
- **XSS vulnerabilities** (Medium severity)
- **Insecure HTTP usage** (Medium severity)
- **Weak random number generation** (Medium severity)
- **Insecure JSON parsing** (Medium severity)
- **Console logging sensitive data** (Low severity)

### 2. JSON Output in Logs
All scan results are now logged in structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "scan_info": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-10T22:30:00.000Z",
    "target_path": "/path/to/file.js",
    "scanner": "CyberRazor Fallback Scanner",
    "total_vulnerabilities": 5
  },
  "summary": {
    "high": 3,
    "medium": 2,
    "low": 0
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [...]
}
```

### 3. Safe File Processing
The scanner:
- Only scans supported file types (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .py, .java, .php, etc.)
- Skips system directories (node_modules, .git, build, dist, etc.)
- Uses regex patterns to detect security issues
- Never executes or modifies your code

## How to Use

### Installation
1. Install the updated VSIX package:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension cyberrazor-4.0.0.vsix
   ```

### Commands Available
- `CyberRazor: Scan Current File` - Scan the currently open file
- `CyberRazor: Scan Workspace` - Scan the entire workspace
- `CyberRazor: View Last Report` - View previous scan reports
- `CyberRazor: Show Output Log` - Show the output panel with JSON logs
- `CyberRazor: Configure Snyk Token` - (Optional) Configure Snyk token

### Testing the Scanner

1. Open the included `test-vulnerabilities.js` file
2. Run the command: `CyberRazor: Scan Current File`
3. Check the output logs for JSON results
4. View the generated HTML report

### Expected Results
The test file should detect approximately **10 different security vulnerabilities** including:
- 5 High severity issues
- 4 Medium severity issues  
- 1 Low severity issue

## JSON Log Output Location

Check the CyberRazor output panel to see the structured JSON results:
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run: `CyberRazor: Show Output Log`
3. Look for sections marked with:
   ```
   === SCAN RESULTS (JSON FORMAT) ===
   { ... JSON data ... }
   === END SCAN RESULTS ===
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No External Dependencies** - Works without Snyk CLI installation
2. **Immediate Results** - Fast scanning with instant feedback
3. **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Customizable** - Easy to add new vulnerability patterns
5. **Safe Operation** - Never executes or modifies your code
6. **Structured Output** - JSON logs for easy parsing and integration
7. **Beautiful Reports** - HTML reports with professional styling

## File Extensions Supported

- JavaScript: `.js`, `.jsx`
- TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`
- Python: `.py`
- Java: `.java`
- PHP: `.php`
- Ruby: `.rb`
- Go: `.go`
- C#: `.cs`
- C/C++: `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`
- Configuration: `.json`, `.xml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`
- Scripts: `.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`
- SQL: `.sql`

## Next Steps

1. Install and test the updated extension
2. Scan your projects for security vulnerabilities
3. Review the JSON output logs for detailed results
4. Use the HTML reports for documentation and sharing
5. Add custom vulnerability patterns as needed

The extension is now fully functional without requiring Snyk CLI installation!
