# üîß CyberRazor Extension - Fixed Version Installation

## The Problem You Were Having
```
ERROR: Command execution error: spawn C:\Users\Minhal Rizvi\AppData\Roaming\npm\snyk ENOENT
```

## ‚úÖ The Solution
I've created a **completely fixed version** that:
- **Removes all Snyk CLI dependencies**
- **Uses hardcoded vulnerability patterns**
- **Outputs scan results in JSON format**
- **Works immediately without any setup**

## üì¶ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Uninstall the Current Extension
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Find "CyberRazor" extension
4. Click the gear icon and select "Uninstall"
5. **Restart VS Code completely** (important!)

### Step 2: Install the Fixed Version
```bash
code --install-extension cyberrazor-5.0.0-fixed.vsix
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
1. Open VS Code
2. Check the status bar - you should see "üõ°Ô∏è CyberRazor Ready" (not "Snyk Not Found")
3. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
4. Type "CyberRazor" - you should see all commands available

## üß™ Test the Scanner

### Test File (create this manually to test):
Create a file called `test.js` with this content:
```javascript
// Test vulnerabilities
const password = "admin123";
const apiKey = "sk_live_[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]";
document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = userInput;
const url = "http://api.example.com/data";
console.log("User password:", password);
eval(userCode);
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId;
```

### Run the Scanner
1. Open the `test.js` file
2. Right-click in the file
3. Select "CyberRazor: Scan Current File"
4. Check the output logs for JSON results

### Expected Results
You should see:
```
[Time] Starting scan of current file: /path/to/test.js
[Time] Using CyberRazor built-in security scanner (no Snyk CLI required)
[Time] Starting safe vulnerability scan for: /path/to/test.js
[Time] Snyk CLI not available, using fallback scanning method
[Time] Running fallback vulnerability scan...
[Time] Found Hardcoded Password in test.js
[Time] Found Hardcoded API Key in test.js
[Time] Found Potential XSS Vulnerability in test.js
[Time] Found Insecure HTTP Usage in test.js
[Time] Found Console Log with Sensitive Data in test.js
[Time] Found Eval Usage in test.js
[Time] Found Potential SQL Injection in test.js
[Time] === SCAN RESULTS (JSON FORMAT) ===
{
  "scan_info": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-10T...",
    "target_path": "/path/to/test.js",
    "scanner": "CyberRazor Fallback Scanner",
    "total_vulnerabilities": 7
  },
  "summary": {
    "high": 4,
    "medium": 2,
    "low": 1
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [...]
}
[Time] === END SCAN RESULTS ===
```

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. JSON Output
All results are now logged in structured JSON format in the output panel.

### 2. No Snyk CLI Required
The extension works completely offline with built-in security patterns.

### 3. Support for Multiple Languages
- JavaScript/TypeScript (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx)
- Python (.py)
- Java (.java)
- PHP (.php)
- And many more...

### 4. Commands Available
- `CyberRazor: Scan Current File`
- `CyberRazor: Scan Workspace`  
- `CyberRazor: View Last Report`
- `CyberRazor: Show Output Log`
- `CyberRazor: Force Show Output Panel`

## üéØ Vulnerability Detection

The scanner detects:
- **Hardcoded passwords** (High)
- **Hardcoded API keys** (High) 
- **SQL injection patterns** (High)
- **Eval usage** (High)
- **Command injection** (High)
- **XSS vulnerabilities** (Medium)
- **Insecure HTTP usage** (Medium)
- **Weak random generation** (Medium)
- **Console logging sensitive data** (Low)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If you still see Snyk errors:
1. **Completely restart VS Code**
2. Check that you uninstalled the old extension first
3. Make sure you're using the new VSIX file: `cyberrazor-5.0.0-fixed.vsix`

### If no vulnerabilities are found in your .tsx file:
The scanner might not find issues if:
- The file doesn't contain the patterns we detect
- The file is mostly clean (which is good!)
- Try the test file above to verify the scanner works

### To view JSON output:
1. Run a scan
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "CyberRazor: Show Output Log"
4. Look for the "=== SCAN RESULTS (JSON FORMAT) ===" section

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
‚úÖ Status bar shows "üõ°Ô∏è CyberRazor Ready"
‚úÖ No Snyk CLI error messages appear
‚úÖ Scans complete with JSON output in logs
‚úÖ HTML reports are generated and opened automatically

The extension now works completely independently without any external dependencies!
